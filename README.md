# What is going on here?!

Hey! Welcome. This is very basic starter pack for creating new project based on specific criteria.
It is specifically designed to work with AppWrite Instance as no-code backend.

# What is the "running force"?

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Vue 3** + Composition API included
- üõ†Ô∏è **Vite** for bundling
- üõü **TypeScript** for type safety
- ü™Ñ **AppWrite** as no-code backend
- üé® **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- üì¶ **Prettier** for code formatting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ESLint** for code linting
- üî¶ **GitLeaks** for GIT repository leaking

**As this is only started template, we're not currently handling responsivity.**

# What is included in package?

- Basic AppWrite implementation
- Wrapper for logged in/not logged in states
- Basic API service example
- Auth service with storing logged in state
- Error handler
